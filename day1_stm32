hardware set is  3-3.3 V like the pico 
and hardware reset is 0 V like the pico
-controllable through the gpio output pins of course 


other than that we also have the gpio input pins which can read the voltage on these pins of course 
some threshold exists , say 1.5 v , SO IF the voltage on the gpio input pin >threshoild voltage - then software reads 1 else it reads 0


need for pull up and pull down resistors , explained in day 1 
they are needed to determine the state of the switch whether the switch is on or off .
pull up resistor when for switch closed you need o reading on your input pin. (resistor towards the vdd side)
pull down resistor when for switch closed you need 1 reading on gpio input pin (resistor toward the gnd side)


the good thing is that stm32 already has pull up and pull down resistor that can be used by just writing a small piece of code so that we dont need to use external ones .
