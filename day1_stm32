hardware set is  3-3.3 V like the pico 
and hardware reset is 0 V like the pico
-controllable through the gpio output pins of course 


other than that we also have the gpio input pins which can read the voltage on these pins of course 
some threshold exists , say 1.5 v , SO IF the voltage on the gpio input pin >threshoild voltage - then software reads 1 else it reads 0
